Each tool has its own features and benefits, but they all work together seamlessly in your editing timeline. You can use them individually or combine them for more creative possibilities.
 
Some of the highlights of Magic Bullet Suite 13.0.4 are:
 
- Colorista IV: A powerful and intuitive color correction tool that lets you adjust exposure, contrast, hue, saturation, shadows, highlights and more with ease. You can also use Colorista IV to create custom LUTs (look up tables) or apply presets from popular films and TV shows.
- Cosmo II: A skin smoothing and retouching tool that can make your talent look their best. Cosmo II can automatically balance skin tones, reduce wrinkles, remove blemishes and even out skin texture. You can also fine-tune the results with sliders for skin color, softness, shine and more.
- Denoiser III: A noise reduction tool that can clean up your footage from video noise caused by low light, high ISO or compression artifacts. Denoiser III uses advanced algorithms to preserve the details and colors of your footage while removing the unwanted grain and noise.
- Film: A film emulation tool that can give your footage the authentic look and feel of real film stocks. Film can simulate the color response, grain structure, contrast curve and aspect ratio of various film formats, from 8mm to 35mm. You can also mix and match different film elements to create your own custom film look.
- Looks: A creative tool that lets you apply stylized looks to your footage with one click. Looks has hundreds of presets that are inspired by popular movies and TV shows, or you can create your own looks from scratch using the intuitive interface. Looks also supports input and output color handling in ACES (Academy Color Encoding System) mode for high-end color workflows.
- Mojo II: A cinematic tool that can give your footage an instant Hollywood look with warm colors, contrast and a subtle vignette. Mojo II can enhance any type of footage, from action to drama to comedy. You can also adjust the strength, tint, bleach and temperature of the effect to suit your taste.
- Renoiser: A film grain tool that can add realistic texture and grain to your footage. Renoiser can emulate the organic look of various film stocks, or you can customize the grain size, amount, color and sharpness. Renoiser can also help you restore some detail and depth to overly compressed or denoised footage.
